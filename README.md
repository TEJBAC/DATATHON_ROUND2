in this round we have decided to go with the problem statement 5 which needs the classification of the vegetables and we have achieved it using machine learning and as an extra feature i have tried integrating APi for the recipe suggestion upon dectected vegetable and also tried the quantity feature using open cv i was not able to show the output because google colab was providing an erro but if tried on VS code it will work fine
all in all this is our project we know there are many shortcoming but we will make to overcome as we speak.
